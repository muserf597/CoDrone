# 🛡️ Drone Cybersecurity Simulator

This project simulates drone telemetry, detects anomalies using machine learning, and generates audit reports—all wrapped in a real-time Streamlit dashboard. Built for aviation safety, cybersecurity innovation, and STEM workforce development.

## 🚀 Features

- ✈️ **Telemetry Simulation**: Generates realistic GPS and altitude data with injected anomalies
- 🧠 **ML Anomaly Detection**: Uses Isolation Forest to identify suspicious flight behavior
- 📊 **Streamlit Dashboard**: Visualizes telemetry, logs, and audit reports in real time
- 📝 **Audit Logging**: Logs anomalies and flight events to text, CSV, and PDF formats
- 🧰 **Modular Design**: Easily extendable for BVLOS, Remote ID, or NDAA-compliant platforms

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `fpdf`, `streamlit`
- Optional: `CoDrone_mini` for hardware integration

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
